Stuff I've learned about git:
- branching kind of creates a copy of a branch with a new name. These will have the same exact log information as the copied branch, master in this case.

.git is a hidden file in the git directory, it's best not to erase it or git will not work.

Commands:

git init

git status

git add
 git add .

git commit -m

-m is always needed, but if it's not included a file will open up for you to write in a message

git -rm --cached <file>
<<<<<<< HEAD

git branch


git checkout

git remote -v

ssh-keygen -t rsa

# this is a good way to avoid having to enter your password all the time.

Just enter blank lines for pass phrases.

git remote add origin git@github.com:jvald8/uge_workshop.git


git remote -v verifies if you got a remote repo

git pull request??  Merge my changes into yours.

Can i add my changes? It's like sending it to the boss and he'll check it out and accept it if it works and reject it if it doesn't.

git branch -d deletes a branch locally.
